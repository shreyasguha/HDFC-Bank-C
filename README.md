# DESCRIPTION

Welcome to HDFC Bank!!

Here you will find my Freshman year project for my computer science course. It consists of a system and interface that allows employees to access and view the existing database of
HDFC accounts. Customers can make their own HDFC account in a slightly gamified manner, using a unique username and password, and link it to their phone numbers, email ids, gender,
age etc. When you create your account you can choose to deposit some money into it. After having an account created you can also access the database but only of your account, using
your username and password. Then you can either choose to withdraw/deposit money into your account, or you can edit details like age, gender, email, phone number etc.

The entire program is written purely in C and contains 653 lines of code
